**University Database Project**  

This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive database system for a university. The project includes creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), developing the database schema, and implementing essential database components:  

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** To define the database structure.  
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** For data querying and modification.  
- **Stored Procedures, Views, and Triggers:** To encapsulate complex logic, provide convenient data access, and automate responses to data changes.  

Additionally, a simple web application built with Flask is included, allowing users to query and interact with the database through a user-friendly interface. This project demonstrates the integration of database design principles with a practical application.
